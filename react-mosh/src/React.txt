1)Not manadatory to have state in the react component file
2)Application bootstrap starts with index.js, ReactDOM.render(<ComponentName>
3)The react actually makes jsx expression to React.createElement(element,type...). In this case if you are having 2 elements then the function gets confused so we need to wrap it in the single element or wrap it with React.fragment
4)Whenever we are dealing with multiline expression then add () to the return else it assumes empty as the element comes next line scenario
5)state is a special object in the controller which actually can be passsed to controller's jsx dynamically or the state object will have data that component needs
6)In jsx we can use {} to render the values dynamically (values should be in the state)
7)If more than 1 element is to be rendered, it is adviced you wrap it in div tags or may be React.Fragment
8)In javascript
true && "Hi" // returns last truth value Hi
true && "String" && 1 // returns last truth value 1
9)In react the click or change events are passed with the reference of the function and not function call.
10)"this' in javascript is like

obj.someFunction // here this is referring to the obj
function something(){} //here this is referring to the window object
If the use strict mode is enabled then the this will be undefined
